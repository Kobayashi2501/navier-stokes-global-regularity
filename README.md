# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes via Energy–Topology–Geometry Approach (v2.1)

This project proposes a novel, reproducible framework for resolving the **global regularity problem** of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).  
By combining unconditional spectral decay, orbit-level geometric compactness, and topological triviality (via persistent homology), this work provides a **type-by-type exclusion** of all known singularity classes—without relying on small initial data or perturbative assumptions.

> 🧭 **Motivating Insight (Author's Note):**  
> The idea stems from projecting high-dimensional dynamics into lower-dimensional structures, where MECE-like clustering emerges in the solution orbit. Each "cluster" corresponds to a blow-up type (Type I, II, III), and the goal is to systematically eliminate these through analytic and topological constraints.

## 🔍 Core Theorem (Simplified Statement)

> **Theorem (v2.1 – Hybrid Regularity Exclusion)**  
> Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free.  
> Then the Navier–Stokes solution \( u(t) \) remains smooth for all \( t \ge 0 \). Moreover, the orbit  
> \[
> \mathcal{O} := \{ u(t) \mid t \ge 0 \} \subset H^1
> \]
> is topologically simple (\( PH_1 = 0 \)), compactly embedded in \( H^1 \), and strictly energy-decreasing.  
> Therefore, no finite-time singularity of **Type I (self-similar)**, **Type II (critical enstrophy)**, or **Type III (non-compact escape)** can occur.

## 🧠 Six-Step Strategy Overview

![6-Step Strategy Overview](outputs/figures/strategy_overview.png)  
*Overview of the proposed 6-step approach integrating decay, analysis, and orbit topology.*

| Step | Method | Singularities Excluded |
|------|--------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **Spectral decay** via shell decomposition | Foundation for regularity |
| 2 | Classical **LPS** / **BKM** criteria from decay | Smoothness guarantee |
| 3 | **Topological triviality** of solution orbit (\( PH_1 = 0 \)) | Excludes Type I |
| 4 | **Stability under small forcing** | Robustness check |
| 5 | **Linear enstrophy control** \( \|\nabla u(t)\|^2 \le C(1 + t) \) | Excludes Type II |

## 🔥 Blow-Up Type Classification

![Blow-Up Classification](outputs/figures/blowup_classification.png)  
*Classification of known finite-time singularities and corresponding exclusion strategies.*

- **Type I (Self-similar):** Ruled out via orbit injectivity and persistent homology
- **Type II (Critical enstrophy):** Prevented by global control on energy growth
- **Type III (Non-compact orbit escape):** Excluded by compactness from Aubin–Lions lemma

## 🌀 Orbit Geometry and PH₁ Triviality

![Orbit Topology Visualization](outputs/figures/orbit_projection_ph.png)  
*Projected solution orbit in a low-dimensional embedding space (e.g., Isomap),  
along with persistent homology barcode diagram indicating \( PH_1 = 0 \).*

This visualization motivates Step 3 by illustrating the injectivity and non-cyclical evolution of the solution orbit.

*Log–log sketch of dyadic shell energy decay \( E_j(t) \sim 2^{-2j(1+\sigma)} e^{-2\nu 2^{2j} t} \).  
This decay underpins the LPS and BKM criteria used in Step 2.*

## 🔬 Numerical + Topological Reproducibility

> Persistent homology (PH) is used to certify topological triviality of the solution orbit.  
> This ensures that no loops or recurrence exist, which is critical to excluding Type I blow-up.

Key techniques:
- Littlewood–Paley shell analysis
- Orbit embeddings in low-dimensional Euclidean space (Isomap)
- Persistent homology via `ripser`, `persim`

# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes via Energy–Topology–Geometry Approach (v3.0)

This repository presents **version 3.0** of a novel framework for proving **global regularity** of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).  
The approach combines **persistent homology**, **Lyapunov-type energy decay**, and **orbit-level geometric analysis** into a deterministic, modular strategy that excludes **all known finite-time singularities**—without any small-data or perturbative assumptions.

> 🧠 **Author’s Note:**  
> This program originated from the idea that **topological simplicity in function space**—measured by vanishing persistent homology—can enforce analytic regularity.  
> By building a bridge from topological data to classical PDE bounds, we show that turbulence and singularities are **topologically constrained phenomena**.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Simplified)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the Leray–Hopf solution \( u(t) \) remains smooth for all time \( t \ge 0 \). Moreover, the solution orbit  
\[
\mathcal{O} := \{ u(t) \mid t \ge 0 \} \subset H^1
\]
is:

- **Topologically trivial**: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \)
- **Energetically dissipative**: \( \frac{d}{dt} \|u(t)\|_{H^1}^2 < 0 \)
- **Compact and contractible**
- **Stable under perturbation** in initial data

Thus, **Type I (self-similar), Type II (slow blow-up), and Type III (chaotic)** singularities are all excluded.

## 🧠 Six-Step Proof Strategy

| Step | Title | Core Idea | Effect |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Topological Stability** | PH₁ barcodes are stable under \( H^1 \) perturbation | Enables topological → analytic inference |
| 2 | **Gradient Control via Topology** | \( C(t) = \sum \text{persist}^2 \) bounds enstrophy | Links topology to smoothness |
| 3 | **Orbit Simplicity** | Injective, finite-length orbits imply PH₁ = 0 | Excludes Type I blow-up |
| 4 | **Topological Irreversibility** | Monotonic PH₁ decay blocks oscillatory/topological return | Excludes Type II/III |
| 5 | **Attractor Collapse** | PH₁ collapse ⇒ finite-dimensional attractor | Long-time regularity ensured |
| 6 | **Perturbation Robustness** | PH₁-triviality preserved under small initial changes | Stability guarantee |

## 🚫 Blow-Up Type Classification

| Type | Nature | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Type I | Self-similar scaling | Excluded via orbit injectivity & PH₁ = 0 |
| Type II | Slow gradient divergence | Excluded via topological Lyapunov decay |
| Type III | Chaotic oscillations | Excluded via persistent barcode stability |

## 🔬 Numerical Philosophy

Persistent homology offers a **verifiable topological signature** of orbit smoothness.  
Combining sampling theorems (Niyogi–Smale–Weinberger) with PH stability (Cohen–Steiner et al.), this method **validates topological triviality** from ε-dense numerical data.

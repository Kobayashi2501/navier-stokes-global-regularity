# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes  
### via Energy–Topology–Geometry–Algebra Approach (v5.0)

This repository presents **version 5.0** of a unified, non-perturbative framework toward resolving the **global regularity problem** for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

The method integrates:
- **Persistent homology** from topological data analysis
- **Spectral energy decay** and **Lyapunov-type enstrophy control**
- **Orbit geometry** and **topological contractibility**
- **Tropical geometric degeneration**, **VMHS theory**, and **Ext-class vanishing**
- **Categorical collapse** and **Derived topology**
- **Critical-space extensions** via wavelet-scale persistence

into a reproducible, modular **7-step proof strategy**, showing that **topological triviality and Sobolev regularity are structurally equivalent**.

> 🧠 **Author’s Note**  
> This framework was developed as a concrete application of the broader  
> [**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory).  
> It interprets blow-up obstructions as low-dimensional projections of collapsible higher-order structure, and resolves them through topological collapse, categorical contraction, and degeneration via mirror symmetry.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Structural Summary)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the corresponding Leray–Hopf solution \( u(t) \) satisfies:

- \( \|u(t)\|_{H^1} < \infty \quad \forall t \geq 0 \)
- \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \), where \( \mathcal{O} = \{u(t)\} \)
- \( E_j(t) \to 0 \) exponentially (dyadic shell energy decay)
- The global attractor is contractible and low-dimensional
- Feedback: \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \iff H^1 \)-regularity (bidirectional)
- Stability under perturbation and stochastic ensemble flows
- Persistent control extends to \( B^{-1+3/p}_{p,q} \) (critical Besov)

> 🔒 **No finite-time singularities (Type I–III) may occur**, assuming the structural assumptions and numerically confirmed topological collapse.

## 🧭 7-Step Strategy (v5.0 Overview)

| Step | Title | Key Idea |
|------|-------|----------|
| 0 | **Motivational Lifting** | Observable complexity arises from projection of higher-order order |
| 1 | **Topological Stability** | Bottleneck-stable PH barcodes imply \( H^1 \)-continuity |
| 2 | **Topological Enstrophy Control** | \( C(t) = \sum \text{persist}^2 \) bounds \( \|\nabla u\|^2 \) |
| 3 | **Type I Exclusion** | Injective, contractible orbit excludes self-similarity |
| 4 | **Type II/III Exclusion** | Barcode entropy decay forbids oscillatory singularity |
| 5 | **Attractor Flattening** | Persistent collapse implies finite-dimensional attractor |
| 6 | **Perturbation Stability** | Robustness under \( H^1 \) perturbation and spectral damping |
| 7 | **Topological Collapse ⇔ Regularity** | Mirror-symmetric VMHS + Ext-vanishing enforces smoothness |

## 🔬 Numerical Pipelines

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pseudo_spectral_sim.py` | 3D pseudo-spectral Navier–Stokes solver |
| `fourier_decay.py` | Dyadic shell spectral energy decay analyzer |
| `ph_isomap.py` | Isomap + persistent homology barcode analysis |

**Key observables**:
- \( C(t) = \sum \mathrm{persist}(h)^2 \): persistent energy
- \( H(t) = -\sum p_h \log p_h \): barcode entropy
- \( s(t) = \frac{d}{dj} \log E_j(t) \): spectral slope
- Persistent threshold: \( \mathrm{persist} < 0.05 \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \)

## 🌀 Foundation: AK-HDPST v4.5

The framework is grounded in  
[**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v4.5)**](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory),  
which enables:

- Lifting PDEs into MECE-structured fiber categories
- Decomposition via PH, categorical degeneration, and mirror symmetry
- Interpreting regularity as a byproduct of **higher-order geometric compression**

This project implements **all 7 AK steps**, including **Step 7: Category-level degeneration** via VMHS + Ext-functor collapse.

## 🚫 Blow-Up Classification and Exclusion

| Type | Description | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| I | Self-similar blow-up | Injective + contractible orbit (Čech–PH) |
| II | Slow-gradient divergence | \( C(t) \to 0 \) forbids sustained topological complexity |
| III | Chaotic oscillation | \( H(t) \to 0 \), structural irreversibility under energy decay |

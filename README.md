# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes  
### via Energy–Topology–Geometry–Algebra Approach (v4.0)

This repository presents **version 4.0** of a unified, non-perturbative strategy toward resolving the **global regularity problem** for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

The method integrates:
- **Persistent homology** from topological data analysis
- **Spectral energy decay** and **enstrophy control**
- **Function space orbit geometry**
- **Tropical geometric degeneration** and **VMHS (Variation of Mixed Hodge Structures)**

into a structurally reinforced **7-step framework**, showing that **topological triviality and Sobolev regularity are mutually enforcing**.

> 🧠 **Author’s Note**  
> This framework originated from the intuition that **topological simplicity of the solution orbit**, captured via persistent homology, could constrain and even enforce analytic smoothness.  
> Version 4.0 finalizes the bidirectional feedback loop between topological collapse and analytic regularity through rigorous algebraic and geometric mechanisms.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Conceptual Summary)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the corresponding Leray–Hopf solution \( u(t) \) satisfies:

- **Global regularity**: \( \|u(t)\|_{H^1} \) remains bounded for all \( t \geq 0 \)
- **Topological triviality**: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \), where \( \mathcal{O} = \{u(t)\} \)
- **Spectral decay**: Dyadic shell energy \( E_j(t) \) decays for large \( j \)
- **Attractor simplicity**: The orbit is compact, contractible, and low-dimensional
- **Bidirectional enforcement**: \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \iff H^1 \)-regularity
- **Stability**: Regularity persists under small \( H^1 \)-perturbations and ensemble uncertainty

No known singularity type (self-similar, slow gradient, or chaotic) may occur under these conditions.

## 🧭 7-Step Strategy (v4.0 Overview)

| Step | Title | Key Idea |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Topological Stability** | Bottleneck-stable persistent homology implies \( H^1 \)-continuity |
| 2 | **Topological Enstrophy Control** | \( C(t) := \sum \text{persist}(h)^2 \) bounds \( \|\nabla u\|^2 \) via Lyapunov-type decay |
| 3 | **Type I Exclusion** | Injective, contractible orbit implies no self-similarity or loop recurrence |
| 4 | **Type II/III Exclusion** | Persistent entropy decay blocks slow or chaotic blow-up |
| 5 | **Attractor Collapse** | \( C(t) \to 0 \) implies low-dimensional, contractible attractor |
| 6 | **Stability Under Perturbation** | Regularity and barcode topology are Lipschitz-stable under \( H^1 \)-perturbations |
| 7 | **Topological Collapse ⇒ Regularity** | VMHS degeneration and tropical barcode contraction enforce smoothness and close the feedback loop |

## 🚫 Blow-Up Type Classification

| Type | Description | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| I | Self-similar | Loop-free orbit ⇒ \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \) |
| II | Slow enstrophy divergence | \( C(t) \) decay contradicts gradient blow-up |
| III | Chaotic recurrence | Entropy \( H(t) \to 0 \) forbids homological return |

## 🔬 Verification Philosophy

Persistent homology enables **topological certifiability** of regularity.  
By using barcode stability theorems and orbit sampling theorems (e.g., Niyogi–Smale–Weinberger),  
we certify that if the orbit remains **homologically trivial**, then the flow remains **analytically regular**.

This bridges numerical and analytic domains:  
**“If the solution orbit is always topologically simple, it must be globally smooth.”**

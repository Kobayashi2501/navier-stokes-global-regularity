# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes via Energy–Topology–Geometry Approach (v2.1)

This project proposes a novel, reproducible framework for resolving the **global regularity problem** of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). By combining unconditional spectral decay, orbit-level geometric compactness, and topological triviality (via persistent homology), this work provides a **type-by-type exclusion** of all known singularity classes—without relying on small initial data or perturbative assumptions.

> 🧭 **Motivating Insight (Author's Note):**  
> The idea stems from projecting high-dimensional dynamics into lower-dimensional structures, where MECE-like clustering emerges in the solution orbit. Each "cluster" corresponds to a blow-up type (Type I, II, III), and the goal is to systematically eliminate these through analytic and topological constraints.

## 🔍 Core Theorem (Simplified Statement)

> **Theorem (v2.1 – Hybrid Regularity Exclusion)**  
> Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free.  
> Then the Navier–Stokes solution \( u(t) \) remains smooth for all \( t \ge 0 \). Moreover, the orbit  
> \[
> \mathcal{O} := \{ u(t) \mid t \ge 0 \} \subset H^1
> \]
> is topologically simple (\( PH_1 = 0 \)), compactly embedded in \( H^1 \), and strictly energy-decreasing.  
> Therefore, no finite-time singularity of **Type I (self-similar)**, **Type II (critical enstrophy)**, or **Type III (non-compact escape)** can occur.

## 🔬 Numerical + Topological Reproducibility

> Persistent homology (PH) is used to certify topological triviality of the solution orbit. This ensures that no loops or recurrence exist, which is critical to excluding Type I blow-up.

Key techniques include:
- Littlewood–Paley shell analysis
- Orbit embeddings in low-dimensional Euclidean space (via Isomap)
- Persistent homology barcode diagrams (using `ripser`, `persim`)

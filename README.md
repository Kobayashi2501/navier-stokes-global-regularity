# üåä Global Regularity of 3D Navier‚ÄìStokes via Energy‚ÄìTopology‚ÄìGeometry Approach (v2.4)

This repository presents **version 2.4** of a novel framework for proving **global regularity** of the 3D incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).  
This approach combines persistent homology, orbit-level geometric compactness, and classical PDE energy analysis to exclude all known finite-time singularities‚Äî**without relying on small initial data** or perturbative assumptions.

> üß† **Author‚Äôs Note:**  
> This project emerged from the intuition that **topological simplicity** in the solution orbit may signal analytic regularity. Persistent homology is used to detect such simplicity, forming a bridge from data topology to PDE analysis.

## üîë Main Theorem (Simplified Summary)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the solution \( u(t) \) to the 3D Navier‚ÄìStokes equations remains smooth for all \( t \ge 0 \), and the solution orbit
\[
\mathcal{O} := \{ u(t) \mid t \ge 0 \} \subset H^1
\]
is:
- Topologically trivial: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \)
- Compact and contractible
- Strictly energy-decreasing: \( \frac{d}{dt} \|u(t)\|_{H^1}^2 < 0 \)

Thus, **Type I, II, and III finite-time singularities** are ruled out.

## üß† Six-Step Hybrid Strategy Overview

| Step | Title | Description | Effect |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Barcode Stability** | Persistent homology is stable under \( H^1 \)-perturbation | Forms analytic‚Äìtopological bridge |
| 2 | **Enstrophy Bound** | Gradient control via Lyapunov function \( C(t) \) from PH | Excludes Type I blow-up |
| 3 | **PH‚ÇÅ Triviality** | Orbit is contractible ‚áí \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \) | Excludes Type I |
| 4 | **Persistent Simplicity** | No topological bifurcation or oscillation occurs | Excludes Type II/III |
| 5 | **Attractor Convergence** | Orbit collapses to a finite-dimensional contractible set | Ensures long-term regularity |
| 6 | **Perturbation Stability** | Structure preserved under small changes in \( u_0 \) | Guarantees robustness |

## üö´ Blow-Up Type Classification

| Type | Nature | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Type I | Self-similar singularities | Excluded via PH‚ÇÅ-trivial, injective orbit |
| Type II | Slow enstrophy divergence | Excluded via persistence-controlled bounds |
| Type III | Oscillatory or chaotic escape | Excluded via topological simplicity + energy decay |

## üî¨ Experimental Mathematics Philosophy

Persistent homology allows **numerical certification** of orbit regularity.  
Through the use of sampling theorems (e.g., Niyogi‚ÄìSmale‚ÄìWeinberger) and PH stability (Cohen‚ÄìSteiner et al.), this approach **reverses the classical logic**: numerical observations (e.g., vanishing PH‚ÇÅ) imply topological regularity.

| Koch‚ÄìTataru | Critical space well-posedness | Scaling-sensitive |
| Escauriaza et al. | Backward uniqueness | Partial type exclusion |

# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes  
### via Energy–Topology–Category–Geometry Collapse (v5.2)

This repository presents **version 5.2** of a structurally complete, non-perturbative framework toward resolving the **global regularity problem** for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

The method unifies:
- **Persistent homology** (PH) via sublevel-set topology
- **Spectral energy decay** and dyadic shell analysis
- **Orbit geometry** and contractibility over time
- **VMHS degeneration**, **Tropical collapse**, and **SYZ mirror flow**
- **Ext-class vanishing** in derived category \( \mathcal{D}^b(\text{AK}) \)
- **Category-theoretic collapse** and **topos-theoretic rigidity**
- Critical-space extensions into \( B^{-1+3/p}_{p,q} \)

All integrated into a **7-step structural proof** that shows:  
> **Persistent collapse (PH₁ = 0)** and **categorical collapse (Ext¹ = 0)** are _jointly sufficient_ for  
> **smoothness of weak solutions**: \( u(t) \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3) \ \forall t > T_0 \)

> 🧠 **Author’s Note**  
> This proof is a concrete realization of  
> [**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory).  
> It reframes blow-up phenomena as **collapse failure zones**, diagnosed via obstruction logic and resolved by derived category convergence.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Collapse Regularity Statement)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \), divergence-free. Then the corresponding Leray–Hopf weak solution \( u(t) \) satisfies:

**If** the following _collapse conditions_ hold for some \( T_0 > 0 \):

- Persistent Homology collapse: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(u(t)) \to 0 \quad (t \to \infty) \)
- Ext-class collapse: \( \mathrm{Ext}^1(F_t, -) \to 0 \), with \( F_t \in \mathcal{D}^b(\text{AK}) \)
- Topological energy decay: \( C(t) = \sum \text{pers}_i^2 \to 0 \)
- Barcode entropy: \( H(t) \to 0 \)
- Dyadic shell energy decay: \( E_j(t) \to 0 \) (Fourier regularity)

**Then**:  
\[
u(t) \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3) \quad \forall t > T_0
\]

This includes full exclusion of:
- Type I (self-similar) singularities
- Type II (oscillatory or bifurcating) structures
- Type III (topological or chaotic) blow-up regimes

> 🔍 Collapse failure cases (e.g. persistent PH₁ ≠ 0, Ext¹ ≠ 0) are diagnosed structurally via  
> the **Obstruction Logic Triplet** in Appendix Z.9.

## 🧠 What This Proof Says — And Implies

This framework does **not rely on perturbation** or special symmetries.  
Instead, it structurally proves the following:

- **Persistent topology and categorical obstruction** are _observable and controllable_ quantities.
- Their **simultaneous vanishing** guarantees the **analytic smoothness** of Navier–Stokes flows.
- Collapse is interpreted as a **semantic trivialization** of the solution’s derived complexity.
- Failure to collapse implies detectable _obstruction classes_, indicating _singularity zones_.

Thus, the v5.2 framework provides:

1. **A structural criterion** for determining when a weak solution must become smooth  
2. **A diagnostic logic** for when and why singularities might persist  
3. **A formal collapse theorem** (Appendix E, Z) that generalizes BKM-type criteria through Ext–PH duality  
4. **A numerically testable roadmap**: using barcodes, spectral decay, and energy profiles

## 🧭 7-Step Strategy (v5.2 Overview)

| Step | Title | Key Idea |
|------|-------|----------|
| 0 | **Motivational Lifting** | Collapse is the _cause_ of smoothness, not a result |
| 1 | **Topological Stability** | Sobolev continuity inferred from PH barcode stability |
| 2 | **Persistent Energy Control** | Topological energy bounds enstrophy evolution |
| 3 | **Orbit Injectivity** | Injectivity of PH₁ trajectory precludes self-similarity |
| 4 | **VMHS Degeneration** | Ext-class collapse corresponds to loop degeneration |
| 5 | **Tropical–Mirror Collapse** | Trop→Ext convergence stabilizes geometry |
| 6 | **Spectral Shell Decay** | High-frequency decay signals analytic regularity |
| 7 | **Collapse ⇒ Regularity** | Dual collapse implies full \( C^\infty \)-regularity |

## 🔬 Numerical Pipelines

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pseudo_spectral_sim.py` | Spectral Navier–Stokes solver (3D Fourier) |
| `fourier_decay.py` | Dyadic shell slope computation |
| `ph_isomap.py` | Isomap + PH₁ barcode analysis |

**Key Observables**:
- Topological energy: \( C(t) = \sum \text{pers}_i^2 \)
- Barcode entropy: \( H(t) = -\sum p_i \log p_i \)
- Spectral slope: \( s(t) = \frac{d}{dj} \log E_j(t) \)
- Collapse condition: \( \max(\text{pers}_i) < \varepsilon \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \)

## 🌀 Foundations in AK-HDPST

This proof is grounded in:
[**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory**](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory)

Key components:
- High-dimensional projection to separate MECE structures
- PH₁ → Trop → Extⁱ functorial degeneration
- Mirror–Langlands–Topos synthesis
- Topological ↔ categorical collapse logic (Appendices A–Z)

> Collapse is seen not as breakdown, but as categorical simplification.

## 🚫 Blow-Up Classification and Collapse Exclusion

| Type | Description | Collapse-Based Exclusion |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Type I | Self-similar singularity | Orbit injectivity + Ext finality |
| Type II | Oscillatory/vortex blow-up | Entropy decay \( H(t) \to 0 \) removes cycles |
| Type III | Topological chaos | Simultaneous PH and Ext collapse ⇒ rigidity zone |

# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes  
### via Energy–Topology–Geometry Approach (v3.2)

This repository presents **version 3.2** of a unified, non-perturbative framework for addressing the **global regularity problem** of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

The approach combines:
- **Persistent homology** from topological data analysis,
- **Lyapunov-type energy decay** from fluid dynamics,
- **Orbit geometry** in function space, and
- **Tropical algebraic degeneration** via mixed Hodge structures,

into an 8-step structure that aims to **exclude all known types of finite-time singularities** — including **Type I (self-similar), Type II (slow divergence), and Type III (chaotic recurrence)**.

> 🧠 **Author’s Note**  
> This project originated from the intuition that **topological simplicity of the solution orbit**—as captured by vanishing persistent homology—could enforce Sobolev regularity.  
> The framework is designed to bridge numerical simulations and rigorous PDE theory via a feedback loop between energy dissipation and topological flattening.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Conceptual Summary)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the corresponding Leray–Hopf solution \( u(t) \) satisfies:

- **Global smoothness**: \( u(t) \in H^1 \) for all \( t \geq 0 \)
- **Topological triviality**: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \), where \( \mathcal{O} = \{u(t)\} \)
- **Energy decay**: \( \frac{d}{dt} \|u(t)\|_{H^1}^2 < 0 \)
- **Attractor simplicity**: The orbit is compact, contractible, and low-dimensional
- **Stability**: Regularity persists under \( H^1 \)-perturbations and ensemble uncertainty

Thus, **no finite-time singularity of any known type** can occur under the assumptions and conditions of the framework.

## 🧭 8-Step Strategy (v3.2 Overview)

| Step | Title | Key Idea |
|------|-------|----------|
| 0 | **Analytic Initialization** | Construct divergence-free initial data and numerical orbit samples; define persistent barcodes |
| 1 | **Topological Stability** | Stable persistent homology ⇒ Hölder continuity in \( H^1 \) |
| 2 | **Topological Enstrophy Control** | Define \( C(t) := \sum \text{persist}(h)^2 \); its decay bounds ∥∇u∥² |
| 3 | **Exclusion of Type I** | Injective, contractible orbit ⇒ no self-similarity or scaling |
| 4 | **Exclusion of Type II/III** | Irreversible topological simplification blocks slow/chaotic singularities |
| 5 | **Attractor Collapse** | Persistent energy decay ⇒ low-dimensional, contractible attractor |
| 6 | **Stability Under Perturbation** | Barcode and regularity are Lipschitz-stable under \( H^1 \) perturbations |
| 7 | **Algebraic–Topological Collapse ⇒ Regularity** | Degenerating barcodes in tropical coordinates imply Sobolev smoothness via VMHS |

## 🚫 Blow-Up Type Classification

| Type | Description | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| I | Self-similar | Orbit has no loops ⇒ PH₁ = 0 |
| II | Slow blow-up | Lyapunov decay of \( C(t) \) forbids long-term enstrophy growth |
| III | Chaotic recurrence | Persistent entropy collapse forbids oscillatory/topological return |

## 🔬 Numerical Verification Philosophy

Persistent homology offers a **topologically certifiable proxy** for analytic regularity.  
Using barcode stability theorems and numerical sampling guarantees (e.g., Niyogi–Smale–Weinberger),  
we infer analytic smoothness from consistent **PH₁-triviality across the orbit**.

This bridges empirical computation and PDE theory:  
**“If the solution orbit is topologically simple at all times, then it must be globally smooth.”**

## 📊 Mathematical Highlights

- Defines a **topological Lyapunov functional** \( C(t) \) that decays with energy dissipation  
- Shows **feedback equivalence**: \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \|\nabla u\|^2 \) bounded  
- Encodes **algebraic collapse** of barcode structure via variation of mixed Hodge structures (VMHS)  
- Demonstrates **tropical convergence** of barcode moduli ⇒ time-smoothness  
- Connects barcode decay to **attractor dimension** and numerical certifiability

## 🌐 Extensions Introduced in v3.2

- **Step 7 Formalized**: Tropical coordinates and VMHS degeneration structure now fully integrated  
- **Appendix I Expanded**: Extensions to critical spaces (e.g., \( L^3 \), \( \mathrm{BMO}^{-1} \), Besov)  
- **Multi-PDE Generalization**: Euler, MHD, SQG, and other vortex-dominated flows considered  
- **Wavelet-based PH**: Suggested for scale-invariant regimes  
- **Ensemble Robustness**: Certifiability under noisy or Bayesian initial distributions

# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes  
### via Energy–Topology–Category–Geometry Collapse (v5.3)

This repository presents **Version 5.3** of a structurally complete, non-perturbative framework aimed at resolving the **global regularity problem** for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The central question is:  
> Do smooth initial conditions always yield smooth solutions to the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for all time?

This v5.3 approach provides a **7-step structural proof** of regularity, formulated without perturbative techniques, by:
- Recasting singularities as **collapse failures** in topological, categorical, and spectral dimensions
- Establishing formal equivalence between **persistent homology**, **Ext-group vanishing**, and **analytic smoothness**

---

## 🧠 Method Overview

We construct a multilayered collapse theory based on:

- **Persistent Homology (PH)**: barcodes from sublevel filtration of Isomap-embedded flow data
- **Spectral Energy Decay**: dyadic shell analysis via Fourier transform
- **Topological Orbit Geometry**: PH₁ contractibility and injectivity over time
- **VMHS Degeneration**: Variation of Mixed Hodge Structure collapse → Ext-class flattening
- **Mirror–Langlands–Tropical Correspondence**: categorical degeneration as geometric collapse
- **Category-theoretic Collapse**: Ext¹ = 0 in \( \mathcal{D}^b(\mathrm{Filt}) \) ensures obstruction-free regularity
- **ZFC-compatible Collapse Axioms**: summarized in Appendix Z

> Collapse is interpreted not as failure, but as **semantic simplification** of high-dimensional flow complexity.

## 🔑 Main Theorem (Collapse Regularity Statement)

Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \), divergence-free. Then the corresponding Leray–Hopf weak solution \( u(t) \) satisfies:

**If**, for some \( T_0 > 0 \), the following conditions hold:

- \( \mathrm{PH}_1(u(t)) \to 0 \quad (t \to \infty) \)
- \( \mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_t, -) \to 0 \quad \text{in } \mathcal{D}^b(\mathrm{Filt}) \)
- Topological energy: \( C(t) = \sum \text{pers}_i^2 \to 0 \)
- Barcode entropy: \( H(t) = -\sum p_i \log p_i \to 0 \)
- Dyadic shell energy decay: \( \log E_j(t) \sim -sj \), with slope \( s > 1 \)

**Then**:
\[
u(t) \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3) \quad \forall t > T_0
\]

> 🔍 See Appendix Z.9 (Collapse Lemma) for formal derivation.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Strategy (v5.3)

| Step | Title | Core Idea |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Lifting Obstruction | Structural collapse replaces blow-up exclusion |
| 1 | Topological Stability | Barcode stability under PH filtration implies Sobolev continuity |
| 2 | Energy–Topology Bound | Persistent energy bounds control enstrophy via topology |
| 3 | Orbit Injectivity | PH₁ injectivity excludes Type I/II blow-up |
| 4 | VMHS Degeneration | Functorial degeneration stabilizes Ext and category gluing |
| 5 | Mirror–Tropical Collapse | Mirror-SYZ and Langlands flatten flow moduli |
| 6 | Fourier Shell Collapse | Dyadic slope decay implies analytic control |
| 7 | Collapse ⇒ Regularity | PH = 0 ⇔ Ext = 0 ⇔ \( u(t) \in C^\infty \): full smoothness by causal chain |

---

## 🔬 Numerical Implementation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pseudo_spectral_sim.py` | 3D Fourier-based spectral Navier–Stokes solver |
| `fourier_decay.py` | Computes dyadic shell energy slope \( s \) |
| `ph_isomap.py` | PH₁ barcodes from Isomap embedding of solution trajectories |

### Measured Observables:

- **Topological energy**: \( C(t) = \sum \text{pers}_i^2 \)
- **Barcode entropy**: \( H(t) = -\sum p_i \log p_i \)
- **Spectral slope**: \( s(t) = \frac{d}{dj} \log E_j(t) \)
- **Collapse detection**: \( \max \text{pers}_i < \varepsilon \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \)

## 🚫 Blow-Up Exclusion by Collapse

| Type | Description | Collapse-Based Elimination |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| I | Self-similar blow-up | PH₁ injectivity + Ext-finiteness |
| II | Oscillatory bifurcation | Entropy decay eliminates looped transitions |
| III | Topological/chaotic | PH₁ = Ext¹ = 0 implies geometric rigidity |

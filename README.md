# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes via Energy–Topology Hybrid Approach (v2.0)

This project presents a speculative but structurally rigorous approach to the global regularity problem for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Developed through an intensive collaboration between a non-specialist and ChatGPT, it combines unconditional spectral decay, energy-topological constraints, and geometric compactness arguments.

## ■ Core Contributions

- **Step 1–2**: Unconditional high-frequency decay leads to classical smoothness and weak–strong uniqueness.
- **Step 3**: Energy monotonicity implies injective orbit geometry and vanishing persistent homology ($PH_1 = 0$).
- **Step 4–5**: Robustness under small forcing and deterministic exclusion of Type I/II blow-ups.
- **Step 6**: Orbit compactness in $H^1$ space rules out non-returning (Type III) singularities.
- **Appendices**: Full reproducibility with Python pseudocode and homological stability under projection.

## ■ Author Note

This project was initiated by **A. Kobayashi**, a non-specialist, as a creative and rigorous attempt to explore an open Millennium Prize Problem. Through sustained interaction with ChatGPT, a six-step framework was developed that bridges PDE analysis, numerical simulation, and topological data analysis.

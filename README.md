# 🌊 Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes via Energy–Topology–Geometry Approach (v2.4)

This repository presents **version 2.4** of an evolving proof framework for the **global regularity of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations** on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \).  
Unlike traditional approaches, this method fuses **persistent homology**, **orbit-level geometric compactness**, and **energy dissipation analysis** into a coherent, six-step exclusion program for all known finite-time singularity types.

> 🧠 **Author’s Note:**  
> This work is rooted in the intuition that topological simplicity of the solution orbit reflects analytic regularity. By quantifying persistent structures through barcode analysis, we establish a topological obstruction to blow-up, without invoking smallness conditions or critical scaling.

## 🔑 Core Theorem (v2.4 Summary)

> **Global Regularity Theorem (v2.4):**  
> Let \( u_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \) be divergence-free. Then the Navier–Stokes solution \( u(t) \) remains smooth for all \( t \ge 0 \).  
> Furthermore, the orbit  
> \[
> \mathcal{O} := \{ u(t) \mid t \ge 0 \} \subset H^1
> \]
> satisfies:
> - Persistent homology triviality: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0 \)  
> - Compactness and contractibility  
> - Strictly decreasing energy \( E(t) := \|u(t)\|_{H^1}^2 \)

Hence, **no singularity of Type I (self-similar), Type II (slow-gradient), or Type III (oscillatory escape)** may form.

## 🧠 Six-Step Hybrid Strategy

![Six-Step Strategy Overview](outputs/figures/strategy_overview_v2.4.png)

| Step | Focus | Singularity Excluded |
|------|-------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Persistent barcode stability under \( H^1 \)-perturbations | Regularity anchor |
| 2 | Enstrophy bounded via PH Lyapunov function \( C(t) \) | Energy-based regularity |
| 3 | Topological triviality: orbit injectivity, contractibility | Excludes Type I |
| 4 | Stability of topological simplicity rules out chaos/divergence | Excludes Type II/III |
| 5 | Structural stability under initial perturbation | Robust under uncertainty |
| 6 | Global attractor collapse via PH flattening | Ensures long-time regularity |

## 📉 Topological–Spectral Link: Step 1–2

![Spectral Decay Sketch](outputs/figures/spectral_decay_sketch.png)

- The function  
  \[
  C(t) = \sum_{h \in \mathrm{PH}_1(t)} \mathrm{persist}(h)^2
  \]  
  is used as a **topological Lyapunov functional**.
- Gradient growth and enstrophy are bounded via  
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}C(t) \le -\gamma \|\nabla u(t)\|^2 + \varepsilon.
  \]
- **Energy dissipation** leads to collapse of topological features: \( \mathrm{PH}_1(t) \to 0 \) as \( t \to \infty \)

## 🚫 Blow-Up Type Exclusion Summary

| Type | Nature | Exclusion Mechanism |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| I | Self-similar scaling | Topological injectivity + trivial \( \mathrm{PH}_1 \) |
| II | Critical gradient divergence | Uniform barcode stability + energy bound |
| III | Oscillatory / chaotic | Persistent non-recurrence via topology |

## 🔬 Experimental Mathematics Philosophy

Persistent homology is used not only as an analytic aid, but as a **numerically certifiable regularity detector**.  
The use of **sampling-density theorems** (e.g., Niyogi–Smale–Weinberger) and **barcode stability results** justifies numerical inference of \( \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \).

## 🔄 Comparison to Prior Work

| Author | Method | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Tao (2006) | Logarithmic energy bounds in critical spaces | Requires small data |
| Escauriaza et al. | Backward uniqueness for critical spaces | Partial type exclusion |
| Koch–Tataru | Critical space well-posedness | Scaling-sensitive |
| **This Work (v2.4)** | Orbit topology + energy decay | All types excluded, no small-data assumption |

## 🧩 Future Directions

We are particularly interested in:

- Expert feedback and counterexamples  
- Numerical validation of topological invariants  
- Extensions to critical norms (\( L^3, BMO^{-1}, \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty} \))  
- Application to Euler/MHD/active scalar PDEs
